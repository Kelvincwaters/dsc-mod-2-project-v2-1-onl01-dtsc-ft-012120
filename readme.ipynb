    "### This project entails utilizing the kc_house_data set to predict housing prices making use of a multivariate linear regression model. The initial dataset consists well over twenty-thousand rows spanding twenty-one columns at approx: 3.5MB. The price is the dependant variable and is the targeted prediction in this notebook, the features are the independent variables. The columns and descriptions in the dataset are as follows:\n",
    "* id - a notation for a house\n",
    "* date - date house was sold\n",
    "* price - price is prediction target\n",
    "* bedrooms - number of bedrooms/house\n",
    "* bathrooms - number of bathrooms/house\n",
    "* sqft_living - square footage of the home\n",
    "* sqft_loft - square footage of the lot\n",
    "* floors - total floors (levels) in the house\n",
    "* waterfront - house which has a view to a waterfront\n",
    "* view - has been viewed\n",
    "* condition - how good the condition is overall(1-5 scale, 5 being excellent)\n",
    "* grade - overall grade given to the housing unit, based on King County grading system\n",
    "* sqft_above - square footage of the house apart from the basement\n",
    "* sqft_basement - square footage of the basement\n",
    "* yr_built - year house was constructed\n",

    "1. **Sqft_living** was an indentical metric to sqft_above and the two shared a correlation holding I surmise identical values, sqft_living has a p-value less than the significance level of 0.05 and is enough to evidence to reject the null hypothesis were the data to favor the hypothesis that there isn't a non-zero correlation. \n",
    "1. The **price_per_sqft** feature was added and had a direct impact on the R-Squared value 0.886 it too showed a p-value less than the significant level of 0.05. I did gather that each independent variable needs to \"interact\" with other independent variables to produce a significant relationship here both the price and sqft_living features. The more precise metric std err of 2.78 may explain this relationship to the dependent variable a value of 3.5 being \"too large\". \n",
